# Express v5 Path-to-Regexp Error Fix

## Issue Description

The application was failing to start with Express v5 due to the following error:

```
TypeError: Missing parameter name at 1: https://git.new/pathToRegexpError
    at name (/workspace/backend/node_modules/path-to-regexp/dist/index.js:73:19)
    at lexer (/workspace/backend/node_modules/path-to-regexp/dist/index.js:91:27)
```

## Root Cause

Express v5 introduced breaking changes to route pattern matching by upgrading the `path-to-regexp` library from version 0.x to 8.x. One of the key changes is that **wildcards must be explicitly named**.

The specific line causing the issue was:
```javascript
app.options('*', cors());
```

In Express v4, this wildcard pattern was acceptable, but Express v5 requires all wildcards to have names.

## Solution

Changed the problematic wildcard route from:
```javascript
app.options('*', cors());
```

To:
```javascript
app.options('/*catchall', cors());
```

## Key Changes Made

1. **Fixed wildcard route pattern**: Changed `'*'` to `'/*catchall'` to comply with Express v5 requirements
2. **Added explanatory comment**: Documented the change for future reference

## Verification

After applying the fix:
- ✅ Server starts successfully with Express v5
- ✅ No path-to-regexp errors
- ✅ All middleware (CORS, express-fileupload, etc.) working properly
- ✅ Application shows "Server is running on port 4000"

## Express v5 Breaking Changes Summary

For future reference, here are the key Express v5 changes that affect route patterns:

1. **Named wildcards required**: `*` becomes `/*name` or `*name`
2. **Optional parameters syntax**: `:name?` becomes `{:name}`
3. **No more regex in routes**: `/:id(\\d+)` no longer supported
4. **Reserved characters**: `(`, `)`, `[`, `]`, `?`, `+`, `!` are now reserved
5. **All parameters must be named**: No more accessing by index

## Files Modified

- `backend/app.js`: Fixed the wildcard route pattern in CORS options handler

## Status

✅ **RESOLVED** - The application now runs successfully with Express v5.1.0
